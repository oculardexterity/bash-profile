# Before you start

You will need to install git prompt. Run the following command in the terminal:

```curl -o ~/.git-prompt.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh```

You will need to open your .bash_profile in an editor of some description. If you're using Atom, you can run the following command:

```atom ~/.bash_profile```

Alternatively you can edit it directly in the terminal with:

```nano ~/.bash_profile```
